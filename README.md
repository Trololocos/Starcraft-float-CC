# Starcraft-float-CC
Calculates how worth it it is to float a CC to another expo. 
Just input the parameters (How many workers are currently mining, how many mineral patches are left, and the time that the CC takes to travel to the next base) and the program will calculate it for you.

Download either the exe or the py (if you have python installed)
